### Education

- Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO, 2008 - 2013
  - Adviser: Edwin K. P. Chong
  - Ph.D. Dissertation: *Modeling, simulation, and analysis of large random systems via partial differential equations*
  - Shrake-Culler Scholarship Recipient
- M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China, 2004 - 2008
- B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, China, 2000 - 2004

### Employement
- Manager, Data Science at SolarWinds in Cambridge, MA, Aug 2015 - Present
  - Managing a data science team of 3 data scientists 2 data analysts (including 2 PhD's and 2 Masters) over two locations (US and UK).
  - Leading projects in time series anomaly detection, network optimization, and business analytics.
  - Interviewed and hired 2 data scientists and 2 data analysts.
- Data Scientist at LogicNow (acquired by SolarWinds in 2016) in Cambridge, MA, Aug 2015 - Aug 2015
  - Designed and implemented machine learning algorithms to predict conversion to paid customers using classification, clustering, R, and Pig. As a result, conversion rate increased from 4% (using a previous heuristic algorithm) to 8%.
  - Built a labeling system to categorize and tag millions of software types using Wikipedia data.
  - Built a near-realtime pipeline to process complex semistructured XML files on S3 and store into Redshift using Python, AWS Lambda, Postgresql, and multiple EC2 instances.
  - Performed business analytics such as growth analysis, churn prediction, market and customer segmentation using R, Python, SQL, AWS. Built automatic email reporting tools for recurring analytics.
  - Processed and analyzed multimillion data records using big data tools Hive, Pig.
  - Worked as one of the first three employees in the company's first data team in a startup-like environment.
- Data Science Intern at Civitas Learning in Austin, TX, Jun 2013 - Jul 2013
  - Analyzed relation between teacher and student behaviors using R and classification, regression, and clustering models.
- Data Modedling Intern at PetRelocation.com in Austin, TX, Jun 2012 - Aug 2012
  - Worked with the director of engineering to build a lead scoring system that improved leads conversion from 2.5% to 7.5% using Navie Bayes models, Matlab, and PHP.
  - Responsible for simulations, algorithm evaluation, and feature engineering including geo info and nature language processing.
  - Developed optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing for sales resource allocation.
- Graduate Research Assistant at Colorado State University, 2008 - 2013
  - Developed new method to approximate large complex models such as random networks by partial differential equations (PDEs). Increased computation speed by replacing computer simulations with PDEs – models computed by multi-week simulations can instead be solved from PDEs in seconds.
- Graduate Teaching Assistant of "Signals, Systems, and Transforms" at Colorado State University, 2009
